# Introduction

Splines are a fundamental concept in computer graphics, animation, and various other fields, playing a crucial role in creating smooth and visually appealing curves and paths. They are used extensively in game development, industrial design, and vector graphics to define the shapes and trajectories of objects, characters, and design elements.

The importance of splines lies in their ability to create complex and organic shapes using a relatively small set of control points. By manipulating these control points, designers and developers can easily modify the shape and behavior of curves without the need for manual adjustments to each individual point along the path.

Splines are like the invisible strings that puppeteers use to control their marionettes, allowing them to create fluid and lifelike movements with ease.

One of the key aspects of splines is their **continuity**, which refers to the smoothness of the curve at the joining points between different segments. Continuity plays a vital role in determining the overall appearance and behavior of the resulting curve, and it is essential to understand the different types of continuity and their implications.

In this deep dive, we will explore the world of splines, focusing on their continuity properties and how they affect the smoothness of the resulting curves. We will start by examining the building blocks of splines, the [Bézier curves](/bezier-curves), and then progress to more advanced topics such as [Bézier splines](/bezier-splines), [parametric and geometric continuity](/continuity), and [other spline types](/other-spline-types) commonly used in various applications.

By the end of this journey, you will have a solid understanding of splines, their continuity properties, and how to harness their power to create smooth and visually appealing curves in your own projects.

So, let's embark on this adventure and unravel the mysteries of spline continuity together!
