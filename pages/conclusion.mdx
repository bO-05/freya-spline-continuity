# Conclusion

In this deep dive into the continuity of splines, we've explored the fundamental concepts and mathematical properties that make splines such a powerful tool for creating smooth curves in various applications. From the humble beginnings of linear interpolation to the advanced techniques of geometric continuity, we've seen how splines have evolved to meet the diverse needs of fields like game development, computer graphics, and industrial design.

We started our journey with [Bézier curves](/bezier-curves), learning how they use linear interpolation to create smooth, parametric curves. We then discovered the limitations of higher-degree Bézier curves and how [Bézier splines](/bezier-splines) address these issues by providing local control and flexibility.

The concept of [continuity](/continuity) took center stage as we delved into the different levels of parametric and geometric continuity. We learned how these continuity types affect the smoothness of splines and the trade-offs between higher levels of continuity and maintaining local control.

Finally, we explored [other spline types](/other-spline-types), such as Hermite splines, Catmull-Rom splines, and B-splines, each with their unique properties and use cases. These splines demonstrate the diversity and adaptability of the spline family, catering to the specific needs of various applications.
