# Bézier Splines

Bézier splines are a powerful tool for creating smooth, complex curves by joining multiple Bézier curves together. They address the limitations of [higher-degree Bézier curves](/bezier-curves/higher-degree-bezier), such as lack of local control and computational inefficiency.

By connecting multiple cubic Bézier curves end-to-end, Bézier splines allow for the creation of intricate shapes while maintaining local control over the curve's shape. This means that adjusting a control point only affects a specific portion of the spline, rather than the entire curve.

## Key Concepts

- **Curve Segments**: Bézier splines consist of multiple cubic Bézier curves joined together, with each curve segment defined by its own set of control points.
- **Knots**: The points where two curve segments meet are called knots or joins. These knots ensure continuity between the segments.
- [**Spline Parameterization**](/bezier-splines/spline-parameterization): The process of mapping the input parameter (usually denoted as $u$) to the appropriate curve segment and local parameter value ($t$) within that segment.
- [**Spline Anatomy**](/bezier-splines/spline-anatomy): Understanding the components of a Bézier spline, such as control points, curve segments, and knots, is crucial for effective manipulation and analysis.
- [**Local Control and Flexibility**](/bezier-splines/local-control-flexibility): Bézier splines provide local control over the curve's shape, allowing for precise adjustments without affecting the entire spline.

## Advantages of Bézier Splines

1. **Smoothness**: Bézier splines create smooth, continuous curves by ensuring that adjacent curve segments share endpoints and tangents at the knots.
2. **Local Control**: Adjusting a control point only affects a specific portion of the spline, making it easier to fine-tune the curve's shape.
3. **Flexibility**: Bézier splines can represent a wide range of shapes by combining multiple curve segments, making them suitable for various applications.
4. **Computational Efficiency**: By using cubic Bézier curves as the building blocks, Bézier splines maintain a relatively low computational cost compared to higher-degree Bézier curves.
